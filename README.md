I'll help you create a comprehensive plan for your film discovery interface. Here's the structured approach:

### Overall Approach

- Create a React application with TailwindCSS
- Implement component-based architecture
- Use Context API for state management
- Implement responsive design patterns
- Structure the application with proper routing

### Data/Resource Access

1. TMDB API Setup

   - Register for TMDB API key
   - Create environment variables for API key
   - Set up API service layer with Axios
   - Implement rate limiting and caching strategies

2. Data Models
   - Movie interface (id, title, poster, genre, rating, etc.)
   - Genre interface
   - User preferences interface
   - Watch history interface

### Solution Steps

1. Project Setup & Core Structure

   - Initialize React project with TailwindCSS
   - Set up folder structure (components, services, hooks, utils)
   - Configure routing (React Router)
   - Create reusable components

2. Movie Grid Implementation

   - Create responsive grid layout
   - Implement lazy loading for images
   - Add infinite scroll
   - Create shimmer loading states
   - Implement image optimization

3. Genre Filter Feature

   - Fetch genres from TMDB
   - Create filter component
   - Implement filter logic
   - Add visual feedback for active filters
   - Handle multiple genre selection

4. Mood-based Suggestion System

   - Define mood categories
   - Create mood-to-genre mapping
   - Implement mood selection UI
   - Create algorithm for mood-based recommendations
   - Add personalization based on watch history

5. Watch History Feature

   - Implement local storage solution
   - Create watch history component
   - Add "Mark as Watched" functionality
   - Implement history management (add/remove)
   - Add watch progress tracking

6. Similar Movie Recommendations
   - Use TMDB similar movies endpoint
   - Create recommendation algorithm
   - Implement recommendation UI
   - Add lazy loading for recommendations
   - Cache recommendations

### Testing & Validation Strategy

1. Unit Testing

   - Test individual components
   - Test utility functions
   - Test API service layer
   - Test state management

2. Integration Testing

   - Test component interactions
   - Test API integration
   - Test routing
   - Test filter functionality

3. Performance Testing

   - Image loading optimization
   - Grid rendering performance
   - API response caching
   - Memory usage monitoring

4. User Testing
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - Accessibility testing
   - Cross-browser compatibility
   - User flow validation

### Edge Cases & Error Handling

1. Network Issues

   - Implement retry mechanism
   - Show appropriate error messages
   - Cache critical data
   - Offline functionality for basic features

2. Data Loading

   - Handle empty states
   - Show loading indicators
   - Handle partial data
   - Implement fallback images

3. User Experience

   - Handle slow connections
   - Manage memory for large lists
   - Handle device limitations
   - Support different screen sizes

4. API Limitations
   - Handle rate limiting
   - Implement request queuing
   - Cache responses
   - Handle API downtime

This plan provides a structured approach to building your film discovery interface while considering important aspects like performance, user experience, and error handling. Each step builds upon the previous one, creating a robust and scalable solution.
